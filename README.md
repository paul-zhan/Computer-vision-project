# 🧠 Melanoma vs Skin Lesion Detection (Computer Vision Project)

This MATLAB-based computer vision project aims to detect and distinguish melanoma from other types of skin lesions using various image enhancement and analysis techniques.

## 🔍 Project Description

Skin cancer detection, especially melanoma, is a crucial field in medical imaging. In this project, we developed and compared different image processing models to assist in early detection of melanoma. The models were implemented using MATLAB and focus on enhancing features that help distinguish between melanoma and benign skin lesions.

## 🛠️ Features

- Preprocessing of dermoscopic images
- Application of Gaussian filtering for noise reduction
- Laplacian operator for edge enhancement
- Gamma correction for contrast adjustment
- Visual comparison of different filtering techniques
- Evaluation of model outputs

## 🧪 Models Implemented

### 1. Gaussian Filtering
- Used for smoothing and noise reduction.
- Helps in removing irrelevant textures before further analysis.

### 2. Laplacian Filtering
- Emphasizes regions of rapid intensity change.
- Highlights edges and boundaries in lesions.

### 3. Gamma Correction
- Adjusts the contrast of the image.
- Enhances darker regions which may contain crucial melanoma patterns.

## 🧬 Technologies Used

- MATLAB R20xx (replace with your version)
- Image Processing Toolbox
